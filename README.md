## 🏗️ Architecture

Built with modern iOS development practices:

- **Swift 6.1+** with strict concurrency mode
- **SwiftUI** with Model-View (MV) pattern (no ViewModels/MVVM)
- **Swift Package Manager** for modular code organization
- **@Observable** and native SwiftUI state management (@State, @Environment, @Binding)
- **Swift Testing** framework with @Test macros and #expect assertions
- **Async/await** throughout with @MainActor isolation, no completion handlers or GCD

### 📝 Development Guidelines

All development follows modern Swift best practices documented in `.github/instructions/`:
- `swift-ios-project.instructions.md` - Project architecture and patterns
- `swiftui-patterns.instructions.md` - SwiftUI development patterns
- `swift-concurrency.instructions.md` - Swift 6 strict concurrency guidelines
- `swift-testing.instructions.md` - Modern Swift Testing framework patterns
- `xcodebuildmcp-tools.instructions.md` - Build, test, and deployment automation

**Key principle:** All new code and features are written in `Project2026Package`, not in the app shell.

### Multi-Platform Support
- 📱 **iOS 18.0+** - Primary experience
- 🖥️ **macOS 15.0+** - Native Mac app
- 📺 **tvOS 18.0+** - Living room mobility routines

### 📺 tvOS App

The tvOS app brings guided mobility routines to your living room with a TV-optimized interface perfect for following along during stretching sessions.

## 🤖 Built with AI

This entire application was **100% built using VS Code and GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode**.

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning** - Used Copilot to help architect the app structure and data models
2. **Implementation** - Agent mode wrote all Swift/SwiftUI code
3. **Testing** - Copilot generated comprehensive test suites
4. **Debugging** - AI-assisted debugging and error resolution
5. **Documentation** - README and code comments generated by Copilot

### Tools Used
- **Visual Studio Code** with Swift extension
- **GitHub Copilot** (Agent Mode)
- **XcodeBuildMCP** for build automation and simulator control
- **Swift Package Manager** for dependency management

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses the modern **Swift Testing framework** with @Test macros:

```bash
# Using XcodeBuildMCP (preferred)
# See .github/instructions/xcodebuildmcp-tools.instructions.md

# Or using xcodebuild directly:
xcodebuild test -workspace Project2026.xcworkspace \
    -scheme Project2026 \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'
```

Tests use `@Test`, `#expect`, and `#require` (not XCTest's test prefix or XCTAssert).

**Example test structure:**
```swift
import Testing

@Test("User can log a workout")
func workoutLogging() async throws {
    let service = FitnessService()
    let workout = try await service.logWorkout(type: "Cycling", duration: 3600)
    
    #expect(workout.type == "Cycling")
    #require(workout.duration == 3600)
}
```
